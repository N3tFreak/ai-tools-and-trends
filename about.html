    <h2>About AI Tools Hub</h2>
    <p>AI Tools Hub was created to make the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence accessible to everyone. We publish clear, actionable guides and news to help you understand how AI tools can improve your daily life and work.</p>
    <p>Our team of researchers tracks trends in AI adoption and technology innovation. We choose topics based on real search data and common questions people ask about AI, so that our articles are easy to find through search engines and social sharing. This approach helps new readers discover us organically, even though we don’t have a large advertising budget or social media following.</p>
    <p>The site is supported through contextual advertising. Ads appear alongside content to fund our work and keep the information free to access. We strive to ensure that advertising is relevant and does not detract from your reading experience.</p>
